# WasteX: Landfill Selection Optimization

WasteX is a Python-based tool developed to solve optimization problems related to landfill selection. The program utilizes Dijkstra's algorithm (Dijkstra, 1959) to determine the 3 optimal landfills for waste collection based on the distances traveled from 9 towns. The tool aims to minimize the distances traveled by waste collection trucks while enabling a maximum of 3 landfills.

## Features

-Optimized Landfill Selection: Efficient identification of the best landfills to minimize transportation distances.

-Minimization of Travel Distance: Reduces the total kilometers traveled by waste collection trucks.

-Consideration of Waste Density and Growth Rate: Factors in waste density and growth rate to ensure efficient waste management.

-Maximum Number of Enabled Landfills: Restricts the number of active landfills to a maximum of 3.

## Requirements

Python version 3 or above, the `pandas` library for data manipulation and reading from CSV files, the `openpyxl` library required for reading Excel files, and the  `pulp` library for solving linear programming problems. You can install them using:

```bash
pip install pandas
```

```bash
pip install openpyxl
```

```bash
pip install pulp
```

## Files

`Toneladas y Distancia.csv`: CSV file containing the distances between towns and landfills in the sheet `Distancia Municipios a Rellenos`.

`fun_algoritmo.py`: Script that contains the main function for calculating and selecting the three optimal landfills.

## Usage
Place the `Toneladas y Distancia.xlsx` file in the same directory as the Python script.

The function `fun_algoritmo()` performs the following tasks:

-Reads the CSV file and extracts the Distancia Municipios a Rellenos data.

-Sums the distances from towns to each landfill.

-Sorts the landfills based on total distance.

-Returns the three landfills with the lowest total distance.

-Coordinate Conversion and Distance Calculation


This project also includes a Python function that converts geographic coordinates from degrees, minutes, and seconds to decimal degrees and calculates relative distances in latitude and longitude between a series of points and a reference coordinate.

## Functionality

-Geographic Coordinate Conversion: Converts geographic coordinates from degrees, minutes, and seconds format to decimal degrees.

-Relative Distance Calculation: Computes relative distances in latitude and longitude between coordinates of points of interest and a predefined reference point.

-Coordinate Data Utilization: The program uses coordinate data stored in a CSV file for easy input and manipulation.


## Structure of the Code

The program utilizes the following key functions:

`fun_algoritmo()`: Returns the best landfill locations based on minimizing distances.

`grados_fun()`: Converts geographic coordinates to a format suitable for visualization on maps.

`minim_fun()`: Calculates optimal locations using the algorithm and updates the map accordingly.

## Conclusion

WasteX provides an efficient solution for optimizing landfill selection and waste management through distance calculations and Dijkstra's algorithm, making it a valuable tool for urban planning and environmental management.
